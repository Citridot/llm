To attain such an exalted state one should control the senses fully, be free from desire, and fix the consciousness on the Supreme.

To help Arjuna, Lord Krishna launches a frontal attack on the thick layers of ignorance of Arjuna. He explains to him the true meaning of life and death and introduces the concept of the soul. He also explains the concept of buddhi yoga, which is the yoga of intellect, and teaches Arjuna how to practice this technique in order to reach the state of psychic union. He explains the sequence of the downfall of a yogi who has been foiled by his senses and urges Arjuna to be always vigilant. Through Arjuna, Lord Krishna provides an assurance that performing actions without attachment will not incur sin. He also speaks of the four types of devotees and their classification with the various approaches to yoga. Through the tenth verse of the seventh chapter, Lord Krishna speaks of the manifestation of Divine and the inner light which leads to wisdom. He reveals the secret of delusion and how to free oneself from the clutches of yogamaya. The twelfth verse of the seventh chapter speaks of God-realization and how one can merge with the Supreme at the time of death.\""
